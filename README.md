## üö© Summary :
## Objective:
To secure question papers using blockchain to eliminate leaks, tampering, and unauthorized access.

## Technology Used:

Blockchain Platform: Ethereum / Hyperledger

Smart Contracts: Automate locking/unlocking of papers

Encryption: AES/RSA for added security

Access Control: Role-based via smart contracts

 ## Key Features:

üîí Immutability: Once uploaded, question papers cannot be altered.

üìà Traceability: All access and changes are recorded on-chain.

‚è±Ô∏è Timed Access: Papers unlock at a predefined date/time via smart contracts.

üë§ Role Management: Different roles for admin, examiner, and centers.

üßæ Auditability: Every transaction is logged and verifiable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Process
Paper Creation: Examiner creates and encrypts question paper.

Upload to Blockchain: Paper is hashed and stored using IPFS/Swarm with hash on blockchain.

Smart Contract Deployment: Smart contract holds the hash and sets access time.

Paper Distribution: On exam day, access is unlocked based on time-triggered contract.

Verification & Access: Only authorized centers can retrieve and decrypt the file using private keys.

## üß† Benefits

## üîê Expert authentication system
Expert's authentication can be the primary security breach to the board's question paper generation and distribution.
The diagram below shows all steps to generate the expert's login data hash from the username, the password, the 6 digit code (that will be provided by respective board to each teacher expert) and the ethereum address. To register the user must fill a form to provide the username, the password and the 6 digit code, the ethereum address is retrieved directly from the wallet. This address is associated to the username to generate a signature via the web3 function sign, the generated signature is hashed (hash1). The password is associated with the 6 digit code to generate another hash (hash2). The two hashes are combined to generated the final hash that is stored in the smart contract(Refer Authentication.sol). To login, the user must be connected to the Blockchain with the same address used during registration, and fill the login form with right username, password and the 6 digit code. The back-end solidity code then generates the hash with this login information and compares it with the hash that was stored in the smart contract by the ethereum address which request the login, if the two hashes match, then the user is authorized to login, if not, the access is denied.
